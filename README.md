# üé≤ GameDex

A personal web app that helps you catalog, organize, and intelligently explore your board game collection. GameDex lets you store rich metadata for each game and leverages AI to suggest games based on your preferences or context.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Game Catalog**: Add, edit, delete, and list board games with structured metadata
- **Rich Metadata**: Track number of players, game type, playtime, complexity, and personal ratings
- **Filtering & Search**: Easily search or filter by game attributes
- **AI Autofill**: Use GPT to fetch game metadata based on title
- **Game Recommender**: Ask natural-language questions like "What's good for 3 players who want something short?"

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Frontend**: Jinja2 Templates with HTMX
- **Database**: SQLite (local) ‚Üí PostgreSQL (production)
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT API
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Package Management**: Poetry

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- Poetry
- Docker (optional)
- OpenAI API key (for AI features)

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd gamedex
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   ```bash
   # Required: Database connection string
   export DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///./gamedex.db"
   
   # Optional: OpenAI API key for AI features
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
   ```

4. **Initialize the database**

   ```bash
   # Run database migrations
   poetry run alembic upgrade head
   ```

5. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

6. **Visit the application**
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`

### Testing

GameDex includes a comprehensive test suite covering models, database operations, AI utilities, API endpoints, and integration tests.

#### Running Tests

**Run tests with pytest directly:**

```bash
# Set up test database
export DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///./test.db"
poetry run pytest tests/ -v
```

**Run specific test files:**

```bash
export DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///./test.db"
poetry run pytest tests/test_models.py -v
poetry run pytest tests/test_api.py -v
```

**Run tests with coverage:**

```bash
export DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///./test.db"
poetry run pytest tests/ --cov=app --cov-report=html
```

#### Writing Tests

When adding new features, please include corresponding tests:

1. **Unit tests** for new functions and classes
2. **Integration tests** for new API endpoints
3. **Database tests** for new models or queries
4. **Update existing tests** if you change existing functionality

Example test structure:

```python
def test_new_feature():
    """Test description"""
    # Arrange
    # Act
    # Assert
```

### Docker Development

1. **Build the image**

   ```bash
   docker build -t gamedex .
   ```

2. **Run the container**

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 \
     -e DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///./gamedex.db" \
     -e OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key" \
     gamedex
   ```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `DATABASE_URL` **(Required)**: Database connection string
  - **SQLite (local development)**: `sqlite:///./gamedex.db`
  - **PostgreSQL (production)**: `postgresql://user:password@localhost/gamedex`
  - **Test environment**: `sqlite:///./test.db`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (Optional): Your OpenAI API key for AI features

### Database Setup

The application requires a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to be set. This ensures consistent database configuration across all environments and prevents accidental use of the wrong database.

#### Database URL Examples

```bash
# Local SQLite development
export DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///./gamedex.db"

# PostgreSQL development
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost/gamedex_dev"

# PostgreSQL production
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@prod-server/gamedex_prod"

# Test environment
export DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///./test.db"
```

#### Running Migrations

After setting up your `DATABASE_URL`, run migrations to create/update the database schema:

```bash
# Apply all pending migrations
poetry run alembic upgrade head

# Check current migration status
poetry run alembic current

# Create a new migration (after model changes)
poetry run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"
```

## ü§ñ AI Features

### Game Metadata Autofill

When adding a new game, you can use the AI autofill feature to automatically populate game metadata based on the title. This uses OpenAI's GPT model to fetch information about the game.

### Game Recommendations

Ask natural language questions to get AI-powered game recommendations:

- "What's good for 4 players who want something quick?"
- "I want a strategy game for 2 players"
- "Something fun and light for a party"

## üé® UI/UX Features

- **Modern Design**: Clean, responsive interface built with Tailwind CSS
- **Interactive Cards**: Hover effects and smooth transitions
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Overview of your collection with key metrics
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works great on all device sizes

## üîí Security

- Non-root Docker container
- Environment variable configuration
- SQL injection protection via SQLAlchemy
- Input validation and sanitization
